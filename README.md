> “The computer programmer is a creator of universes for which he alone is the lawgiver. No playwright, no stage director, no emperor, however powerful, has ever exercised such absolute authority to arrange a stage or field of battle and to command such unswervingly dutiful actors or troops.”
― Joseph Weizenbaum

I study programming since a few years ago and in this year I'm totally focused in web development, since backend until frontend and wishing to start to study in mobile development in the future.

### What I'm focusing on now
Currently improving React skills to learn the main concepts of this library and CSS skills to try diferent layouts. :)
